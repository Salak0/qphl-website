_An open letter to the QPHL community and our families_

I met with Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) members of Our community last week to start a conversation. Amongst other things, we discussed how they were feeling about the current heightened awareness and tension around racial and ethnic diversity and what Our community could do for or with them. This open letter is one of those things; it isn't the end of the conversation.

I like many of you have watched how, yet again, a black man in the USA is killed by the very institution that exists to protect the public. The call for change is welcomed but depressingly familiar. That call for change needs to be heeded, both where overt and absolute discrimination exists, and where it may express itself in more subtle ways, perhaps only detected by the injured party.

There are signs in survey responses that attitudes are changing in the UK; a small and reducing minority holds these racist attitudes. This correlates strongly with age. In my public life (21 years as an elected local Councillor) I am acutely aware that it isnâ€™t necessarily an overtly expressed racist attitude that drives discriminatory behaviours (in institutions or individuals) that in turn deliver different opportunities and outcomes. It can often be differential expectations held by employers, schools, police forces, landlords, etc. that can drive those differential behaviours meaning those of us with a racially diverse heritage gets treated differently.

The purpose of this letter is to show that Our community stands together with our members from an ethnically or racially diverse heritage. It is important to me that Our community is a safe place in which all can thrive. I should state that I believe it is. It is reassuring that our BAME community members who met with me last week report no negative experiences in our workplaces. However, I am not immune to the prospect that as our organisation grows, we may develop blind spots.

There is and will remain a zero-tolerance approach to any discriminatory practice based on BAME heritage, as there also is for all forms of discrimination.

There are several ideas we discussed during our meeting that might help us avoid the sorts of unconscious bias that can easily slip into processes unchecked. We are reviewing any pay differentials that might exist and share the outcome internally. We will explore the usefulness of blinding recruiting. Some of our BAME community members will be recording their experiences with racism on video, and we will be sharing them internally. We will begin celebrating our different cultures by promoting the meaning and purpose of some of the festivals we observe.

Thank you to our team members with BAME heritage who met with me last week. That was a useful start. We agreed we needed to widen the conversation to the whole of Our community, including our families, so we can build a tolerant and inclusive place in which we can all thrive together.

My door remains open to that conversation as do those of the whole leadership team.
