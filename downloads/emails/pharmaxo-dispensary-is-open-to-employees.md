Good morning all,

Some of you may have heard rumours that the Pharmaxo dispensary is closed to staff. This is not true.

In order to reduce the risk of infection for all QPHL staff, the Pharmaxo dispensary is operating a 1 hour window between 2pm and 3pm each day where staff can purchase over-the-counter medication etc.

Our goal is to reduce unnecessary visits, protecting staff from contracting any illness and maintaining the essential service we provide. If you have an urgent query, personal prescription, or cannot present at the pharmacy between 2pm and 3pm, please call 101 (internal extension) and a pharmacist will advise the best course of action over the phone.

Key points:

- Call ahead on 101 (internal) if you are unsure.
- Please use the main SP1 entrance and use the hand gel provided. We will ask you to wait outside to avoid all unnecessary contact in line with social distancing guidance.
- We are still able to process prescriptions for all QPHL staff.
- We can sell over-the-counter medication between 2pm to 3pm, Monday to Friday.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Kind regards

**John Ashton-Barnett**<br>
Dispensary Manager
